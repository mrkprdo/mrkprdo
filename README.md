My stuff:

I released a python package in pypi.org called [RandoMouse](https://pypi.org/project/randomouse/) ([repo](https://github.com/mrkprdo/RandoMouse/tree/master/randomouse)). I made this just to make my mouse move when I step away from my computer. Only works on Windows. 

I have other stuff soon that i will put here on my github which will be useful. For now, whats in there is garbage. LOL

Anyway, thanks for checking my github page. Feel free to connect.
